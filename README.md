#TrumPoem Generator

The new President of the United States is, in his own words, of the highest, BIGGEST caliber in almost all things. This project is a (growing) set of scripts to generate poems from the President's speeches and tweets.

The scripts should have descriptive names telling you from which body of words each is using as source material. Simply run the script at the command line, providing an integer argument for the number of words you wish to generate in the poem.

Eventually, these scripts will be folded into Twitter bots and whatever else I can think up.
